The evolution of the universe as predicted by the Friedmann equations when dominated by a single, isotropic, stable, static, perfect-fluid energy form is discussed for different values of the gravitational pressure to density ratio ùë§. These energy forms include phantom energy (ùë§<‚àí1), cosmological constant (ùë§=‚àí1), domain walls (ùë§=‚àí2‚àï3), cosmic strings (ùë§=‚àí1‚àï3), normal matter (ùë§=0), radiation and relativistic matter (ùë§=1‚àï3), and a previously little-discussed form of energy called ‚Äúultralight‚Äù (ùë§>1‚àï3). A brief history and possible futures of Friedmann universes dominated by a single energy form are discussed.
